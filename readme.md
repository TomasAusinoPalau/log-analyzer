# Log Analyzer

Log Analyzer is a command-line tool designed to process and analyze web server log files. It identifies user sessions, calculates various metrics, and generates a detailed report.

---

## Features

- **User Session Analysis**: Detects user sessions based on a 10-minute inactivity threshold.
- **Top User Insights**: Displays top users by page views with session details.
- **Parallel and non-blocking processing**: File reading and report generation are async and non blocking, providing efficiency and scalability.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and use the Log Analyzer on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Scala 2.13**
- **SBT (Scala Build Tool)**
- **Java 8 or newer**

### Installation
```
git clone <repository-url>  
cd log-analyzer 
```

## Usage

1. Compile the project:
```
sbt compile
```

2. Run the analyzer with the path to your log files directory:
```
sbt "run /path/to/logsDirectory"
```

## Output Example

An example report generated by the Log Analyzer:

Total unique users: 27  
Top users:

| id        |# pages|# sess|longest| shortest |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 71f28176  | 75    | 3    | 35    | 1        |
| 41f58122  | 65    | 4    | 60    | 10       |
| 58122233  | 44    | 2    | 121   | 3        |

## Priorities in the Design Process

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The codebase was structured to prioritize readability and maintainability, ensuring that can be easy to understand and extend the functionality.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Given the nature of log processing and potentially large data volumes, we designed the system to handle tasks asynchronously. This approach optimizes performance and ensures scalability for larger datasets.

3. **Modular Architecture**: Each component was designed with single responsibility principles, allowing individual modules to be tested and reused independently.

4. **Functional Paradigms**: The implementation leverages functional programming principles, such as immutability and higher-order functions, to ensure predictable and reliable behavior.
